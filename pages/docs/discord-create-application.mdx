# Discord Developer Application

This application interacts with the [Discord API](https://discord.dev) and therefor requires you to create a Discord Developer Application. What you need to know about this side of Discord, is that you have both `Applications` and `bots`. What we will be focusing on here is the `bot`, the `Application` is mostly used for user authorization on websites using [`OAuth2`](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2), but it's still a requirement for our bot user.

<Callout type="info">If you were directed here from a different guide or tutorial, there's a button at the bottom of this page that takes you back to your guide</Callout>

<Callout>Not all applications can use an existing bot account. If the project you're setting up can't share a bot account with multiple processess, there will be a notice in the project guide - like this one!</Callout>

<Steps>

### Go to Discord Developer Portal

Let's get started by creating the new application by navigating to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), and clicking the `New Application` button in the top right (Located in the `Applications` left-hand menu)

### Create the application

In the modal/prompt that shows up, provide your application with a cool name, and click the checkbox to agree to the Discord Developer [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service) and [Developer Policy](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy)

<Callout type="error">Don't use `Discord` in the bot or Application name - this is a reserved keyword for Discord staff and will error if present</Callout>

### Customize your application (optional) [#customize-application]

Optionally provide your application with a cool image, description, and some tags for [App Directory](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/9360431966359-Welcome-to-the-App-Directory-) later on

### Obtaining your token

To obtain your token (otherwise referred to as Discord Bot Token), navigate to `Bot` in the left-hand menu, and click `Reset Token` - this **will** invalidate/expire all other tokens - meaning you can only view this secret **once**, so keep it somewhere safe

#### Token

**Token** is your `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`

#### Intents

This is also where you enable `Privileged Gateway Intents` for your bot, like `Presence Intent`, `Server Members Intent`, and `Message Content Intent`

<Callout type="error">
  If you're setting up the [CFTools Discord bot](/docs/cftools-discord-bot) you **will need** to check the `Message Content` intent as this is required for multiple modules the bot offers
</Callout>

### Add the bot to your server [#add-to-server]

Lets navigate to `OAuth2` in the left-hand menu, and click `General` in the menu that was expanded.


<Callout type="info">Alternatively to this guide, if you know what you're doing, replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your actual [Client ID](/docs/discord-create-application#client-id) in the following URL and open it in a new tab: `https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands`</Callout>

#### Client ID

**Client ID** is your `CLIENT_ID` - this is also referred to as `Discord Bot ID` and `Application ID`

Copy your `Client ID`, and keep it somewhere safe - you **will** need this later

![client-id](/images/guides/discord-create-application/client-id.png)

#### URL Generator

Next up, navigate to `URL Generator` in the same expanded menu (in the `OAuth2` left-hand menu)

1. Click the `bot` and `applications.commands` **scopes**
2. Click the relevant **permissions** for your bot, or select `Administator` if you're not sure

<Callout type="error">Only give the `Administrator` permission to bots you own, or bots you otherwise trust. Bots with `Administrator` are essentially able to wipe your entire Discord server - channel, roles, members, everything - so be careful</Callout>

![url-generator](/images/guides/discord-create-application/url-generator.png)

#### Generated URL

Scroll down (stay on the same page), and copy the `Generated URL` at the bottom of your screen. Open this in a new window.

![generated-url](/images/guides/discord-create-application/generated-url.png)

#### Authorize

In this new screen, follow the page's instruction to add the bot to your Discord server:

</Steps>

<Callout type="info" emoji="âœ…">That's all. You have now created your own Discord Developer Application with Bot user. Note down your credentials for this application, and store them somewhere safe.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Did you know - The Discord Developer portal is directly available at [discord.dev](https://discord.dev)</Callout>
