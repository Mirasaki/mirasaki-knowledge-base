# Client Permissions

<Callout type="info">*You can modify `Moderators`, `Administrators`, `Developers` and the `Bot Owner` in `/config/config.js`, this is optional*</Callout>

These are permission levels that are used internally by the bot to determine which commands specific users have access to. `/help` and `/commands` help menus are personal, and account for this dynamic, internal permission level. Available permissions levels are:

- 0 - User - This is the default permission levels, everyone has this this - doesn't have access to any dangerous or otherwise sentive commands or functionality
- 1 - Moderator - The moderator permission level has access to moderation commands like `/heal`, `/kick`, and `/ban`. Anyone that has the Discord permissions `Kick Members` and `Ban Members`, or has a role that is defined in the [`config#permissions#moderatorRoleIds`](/docs/cftools-discord-bot/2-configuration#values) is considered a Moderator
- 2 - Administrator - The Administrator permission level is the highest permission level that can be assigned through Discord. Anyone with the Discord permission `Administrator`, or has a role that is defined in the [`config#permissions#administratorRoleIds`](/docs/cftools-discord-bot/2-configuration#values) is considered an Administrator internally and will have access to dangerous/sensitive commands like `/broadcast`, `/dm-survivor`, and `/spawn-item`
- 3 - Server Owner - This is the permission level of your Discord server owner, only 1 person can have this at any given time. Used to make sure server owners have a snowflake permission level internally üôè Doesn't currently have any exclusive commands, but you can choose to restrict commands to this permission level as needed
- 4 - Developer - This is for members that develop on the bot, has access to dev utilities like `/eval` and `/exec`. This permission level can do almost everything, including evaluating arbitrary code on your host machine - use with caution!
- 5 - Bot Owner - Bypasses every permission and level check, has access to every command and all interaction components.

You can modify required permission levels to execute commands in the command files by setting the `permLevel` property. Let's take a look at an example `/src/commands/` file:


```javascript
module.exports = new ChatInputCommand({
  // Inside of the ChatInputCommand({
  // Can be set to User, Moderator, Administrator, Server Owner, Developer, Bot Owner
  // Support IntelliSense/auto-complete
  permLevel: 'Administrator',
  // ... other properties
  run: async (client, interaction) => {
    // The commands #run/execute function
  }
});
```
