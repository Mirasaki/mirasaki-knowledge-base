# üõ†Ô∏è Server Configuration

All server configuration is done in `config/servers.js` and multiple servers are supported. This file contains all configuration variables/options that apply on a (DayZ) server-specific level. For example, you can have a DayZ server with a live-chat module, while your second server has this entirely disabled. Configuration is shared between Discord guilds/servers. 

## Creating the file

1. Navigate into the `/config` folder
2. **Copy & Paste** `servers.example.js` and **rename** the file to `servers.js`
3. Fill in your server configuration values

<Callout type="error">It is important that you leave the `.example` file intact. This is used to point out the differences in configuration when you update to later versions. Aside form that, renaming the `.example` file directly will also create merge issues when updating to later versions</Callout>

## Server configuration options explained [#configuration-explained]

This section will explain what the different configuration options mean. The configuration options can be categorized into separate modules:

### Global (required) [#global]

Configuration that is required for most of our functionality to work, these should be considered required, meaning you **will** have to change these values to your own. Everything else can be considered optional and therefor left on the default values

| Configuration Option   | Description | Type |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| `NAME`    |  The name used to identify this server, used internally and when selecting servers in Discord   |   string |
| `CFTOOLS_SERVER_API_ID` | Your CFTools Server API-ID, refer to [the guide](/docs/cftools-server-api-id)  | string |
| `SERVER_IPV4` | Your DayZ game-server's public IP address, your users use this to connect to your server  | string |
| `SERVER_PORT` | Your DayZ game-server port, **not** your steam-query port  | number |

### Webhook Configuration

Configure a CFTools webhook for your server, this is used for (including, but not limited to) the live-chat module and delayed kill-feed.

This configuration instructs the bot to extract information from the CFTools webhook messages (game events, like `player.kill` and `user.join`) to be used across multiple different modules. This approach was chosen to avoid having to setup an HTTPS-enabled web-server.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out [our guide](/docs/gameshield-getting-started) if you need help setting up your CFTools webhook - it's made for a different project, but the process is the same. (step 7 is not relevant for this project)
</Callout>

| Configuration Option   | Description | Type |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| `CFTOOLS_WEBHOOK_CHANNEL_ID` | The id of the channel where CFTools webhook messages are send  | string |

### Command Configuration

These configuration options apply changes to commands/functionality that aren't considered modules

| Configuration Option   | Description | Type |

| `STATISTICS_INCLUDE_ZONES_HEATMAP` | Include the zones heatmap image in the /statistics command  | boolean |
| `STATISTICS_KEEP_PUPPETEER_BROWSER_OPEN` | Keep the Chromium browser open - this generates the heatmap faster, but uses ~20 MB more RAM  | boolean |

| `SERVER_INFO_INCLUDE_MOD_LIST` | Include mod list output/embeds in `/server-info`  | boolean |

### Live Chat Module

This application offers a module that let's you dynamically forward/relay chat from members in Discord, to your DayZ server - use these configuration options to modify/personalize the module

<Callout>Requires the privileged "Message Content Intent" ([discord.dev](https://discord.com/developers/applications) &gt; Your App &gt; Bot &gt; `Message Content Intent` - check out [this guide](/docs/discord-create-application#intents) if you need more information)</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Max message length is `256` characters, and a members tags and display name count towards that</Callout>

<Callout type="error">If live-chat messages in game display as BattlEye errors, you'll most likely have to disable `advancedChatInterface` in your Gamelabs mod configuration, this is due to mod conflicts</Callout>

| Configuration Option   | Description | Type |
| :---- | :----: | ----: |
| `USE_CHAT_FEED` | Enable or disable the chat feed module  | boolean |
| `CHAT_FEED_CHANNEL_IDS` | The channels where members can send messages that get forwarded to DayZ  | string[] |

### Delayed Kill Feed configuration

| `USE_KILL_FEED` | Should the module be enabled for this server configuration  | string |
| `KILL_FEED_DELAY` | How long to wait (in seconds) before forwarding the killfeed message  | string |
| `KILL_FEED_CHANNEL_ID` | The id of the channel where killfeed messages should be forwarded/send to  | string |
| `KILL_FEED_MESSAGE_IDENTIFIER` | The string that indicates if something should be included in the kill-feed relay, [more info](#kill-feed-message-identifier)  | string |
| `KILL_FEED_REMOVE_IDENTIFIER` | Should the identifier be removed from the message before forwarding/relaying  | boolean |

#### Kill Feed Message Identifier

The kill feed message identifier is a string that is used to determine if a message should be included in the kill feed relay. This is used to prevent messages that are not kill-feed messages from being relayed, and to include other CFTools webhook events as desired by your community.

The default value is ` got killed by `, which only matches the default CFTools message for the `player.kill` event.

If you want to include other events, you can (for example): 

##### Update your configuration (servers.js)

1. Use `KILL_FEED_INCLUDE | ` as the `KILL_FEED_MESSAGE_IDENTIFIER` value
2. Change `KILL_FEED_REMOVE_IDENTIFIER` to `true`, this will remove `KILL_FEED_INCLUDE | ` from the message before relaying it

##### Update your CFTools webhook templates

1. Navigate to your [CFTools Dashboard](https://app.cftools.cloud/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your server > `Manage` > `Integrations`
3. Find the webhook that is being used for the kill-feed relay
4. Click `Templates` and copy-paste the `KILL_FEED_MESSAGE_IDENTIFIER` value at the start of every event you want to include as displayed below

  }, <-- Notice the comma - always add this when adding a new server block
  {
    ...
  }
]
```
