# Starting the application

## Docker (preferred)

The quickest and easiest way to host/start this application is by deploying it inside a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ "Official Docker Website") container. We recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### Build the project [#create-build]

Run `docker compose build` to create your docker build (this needs to be ran from the project root).

### Start the bot

Run the command `docker compose up -d` to start the bot in the background.

Once the bot is running, you can check the logs by running `docker compose logs -f`. (ctrl+c to exit)

## NodeJS

Start the application using any of the following approaches, in preferred order:
    - `npm run pm2:start` to keep the process alive with [PM2](https://pm2.io/ "PM2 | Official Website"), suitable for production environments. (`npm i -g pm2` to install)
    - Use the `node .` command (stops the bot if you close the command prompt)
    - `npm run start:dev` if you have `nodemon` installed for automatic restarts on changes, suitable for development environments
