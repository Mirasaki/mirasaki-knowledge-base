# Prerequisites

There's several prerequisites to this application that are documented below

## CFTools Developer Application

This application interacts with the [CFTools Data API](https://developer.cftools.cloud/documentation/data-api) and therefor requires you to create a Developer Application. If you already have a CFTools Developer Application, feel free to re-use your credentials and skip to [the next part](#discord-developer-application) of this guide.

<Callout type="info">Please follow our [guide](/docs/cftools-create-application) on creating new CFTools Developer Applications. You will be redirected back here afterwards</Callout>

## Discord Developer Application

Next up is the Discord bot user/account. This will be used to log our bot in to Discord, allowing you to communicate with it through commands & other components. If you already have a Discord Developer Application, feel free to re-use your credentials and skip to [the next part](#docker) of this guide.

<Callout type="error">Re-using a previously created Discord Developer Application/bot account is not possible. This application cannot be shared with another process running on the same bot account without modifying the source-code</Callout>

<Callout type="info">Please follow our [guide](/docs/discord-create-application) on creating new Discord Developer Applications. You will be redirected back here afterwards</Callout>

## Docker (preferred) [#docker]

The easiest method to install and use this application is by running it in a Docker container. We personally recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows users, and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for other operating systems. A simple `docker run` command will work fine as well.

<Callout type="info">An example `docker-compose` file is provided in the source directory of this application, along with raw docker command examples to get you started using Docker in the `/package.json > scripts`</Callout>

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  client:
    # Build using the default Dockerfile
    build: .
    container_name: client
    # Always restart, recovers the process from errors
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # Bind mount, read-only app
      - ./:/app:ro
      # Anonymous volume
      - /app/node_modules
    # Include our environmental config file
    env_file:
      - ./config/.env
```

## NodeJS (if not using Docker) [#nodejs]

<Callout>Only use this if the preferred approach, [Docker](#docker), doesn't work for you</Callout>

<Steps>
### Go to the download page

Head on over to the [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Download latest LTS

Download the latest LTS build available for your OS

### Install necessary tools

Be sure to check the box that says "Automatically install the necessary tools" when you're running the installation wizard

</Steps>

## [Chromium Browser](https://www.chromium.org/Home/) [#chromium]

<Callout type="info">You need this if you want to use/display `/statistics` hit-zone heat-maps - can be ommitted through the [configuration file](/docs/cftools-discord-bot/configuration)</Callout>

- Comes with most Windows installations, if not - [download](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) the application
- `sudo apt-get install chromium-browser` for most Linux distributions, or use your distro's apt-alternative (package manager) - if this doesn't work you might have to point `puppeteer` to your browser executable.
- `brew install chromium && which chromium` on Mac OS
