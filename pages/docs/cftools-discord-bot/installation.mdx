# 🔨 Installation (NodeJS)

You will need [Node/NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node official website") installed for this approach, as addressed in [prerequisites](/docs/cftools-discord-bot/0-prerequisites)

<Steps>

### Download the source files [#download-files]

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Mirasaki/cftools-discord-bot/releases) from GitHub

<Callout type='info'>[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) with Git if you're planning on frequently updating to the latest version or contributing to development</Callout>

### Open source files [#open-files]

Open the newly created folder (**extract** the compressed file if you've downloaded the latest release) in Windows Explorer if you're on Windows, or `cd cftools-discord-bot` into the folder otherwise

### Install dependencies [#install-deps]

<Callout>This step can be skipped if you're on Windows and plan on using the `start.bat` file to start the bot</Callout>

Open a new command prompt in the newly created folder/source files and run `npm install` to install all project dependencies

</Steps>

That's all! Let's continue by setting up our [configuration files](/docs/cftools-discord-bot/2-configuration)
