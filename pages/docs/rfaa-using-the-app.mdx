# Using the application

To use this application, you will have to make HTTP requests to the API that this application opens up.

By default, your application will be online at port `9000` and available at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Using a custom domain, and SSL/TLS - requires a webserver configuration, like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - but that is not in scope of this tutorial

## Authenticating

To authenticate yourself, and get access to the files you've allowed access to remotely, you'll need to provide the authorization header:

<Callout type="error">This is why you need a strong `API_KEY`, never share this sensitive information - it should be threated as a password</Callout>

```
  'x-api-key': '__YOUR_API_KEY__'
```

Any request without this specific authorization header will only be able to check if the application is online or not, but not see any file contents

## Routes
<Callout>The parameter `:name` is the `NAME` you provided in your configuration. This is true for all subsequent routes.</Callout>

### `GET` /

Status endpoint, publicly available

### `GET` /options

Options endpoints, displays all available routes (not methods) according to your configuration

### `GET` /files/:name

Get file contents

### `GET` /json/:name

Get all JSON data from directory

### `GET` /json/:name/:identifier

Get JSON data belonging to identifier.

<Callout>The `identifier` parameter is dynamic, and will ultimately resolve in the path: `<DIRECTORY>/<identifier>.json` - this is true for all subsequent routes</Callout>

### `DELETE` /json/:name/:identifier

Delete JSON data belonging to identifier

### `PUT` /json/:name/:identifier

Save the request body as the full, new content/data for specified JSON entry

### `PATCH` /json/:name/:identifier

Apply request body key-value pairs to JSON entry *individually*
