# Using the application

To use this application, you will have to make HTTP requests to the API that this application opens up.

By default, your application will be online at port `9000` and available at [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

Using a custom domain, and SSL/TLS - requires a webserver configuration, like [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) - but that is not in scope of this tutorial

## Authenticating

To authenticate yourself, and get access to the files you've allowed access to remotely, you'll need to provide the authorization header:

<Callout type="error">This is why you need a strong `API_KEY`, never share this sensitive information - it should be threated as a password</Callout>

```
  'x-api-key': '__YOUR_API_KEY__'
```

Any request without this specific authorization header will only be able to check if the application is online or not, but not see any file contents
