# Prerequisites

There's several prerequisites to this application that are documented below

## Docker (preferred) [#docker]

The easiest method to install and use this application is by running it in a Docker container. We personally recommend [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for Windows users, and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for other operating systems. A simple `docker run` command will work fine as well.

<Callout type="info">An example `docker-compose` file is provided in the source directory of this application, along with raw docker command examples to get you started using Docker in the `/package.json > scripts`</Callout>

```yaml
version: '3.1'

services:
  remote-file-access-api:
    build: .
    container_name: remote-file-access-api
    restart: always
    volumes:
      # Bind mount, read-only app
      - ./:/app:ro
      # Anonymous volume
      - /app/node_modules
```

## NodeJS (if not using Docker) [#nodejs]

<Callout>Only use this if the preferred approach, [Docker](#docker), doesn't work for you</Callout>
