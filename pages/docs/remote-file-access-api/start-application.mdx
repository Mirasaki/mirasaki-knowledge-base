# Starting the application

Run the command `npm run build` to build your application

Start the application using any of the following approaches, in preferred order:
    - Use the `node .` command (stops the application if you close the command prompt)
    - `npm run pm2:start` to keep the process alive with [PM2](https://pm2.io/ "PM2 | Official Website"), suitable for production environments. (`npm i -g pm2` to install)
    - `npm run dev` if you have `nodemon` installed for automatic restarts on changes, suitable for development environments
