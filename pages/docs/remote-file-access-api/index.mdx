# Overview

Allows remote access to local files and JSON databases through a simple configuration file. Minimal set-up, maximum configuration and extendibility

Very useful to quickly and easily allow access to local files from anywhere in the world. File contents and JSON database interfaces can be used in any application over HTTP (`application-json` content), allowing you to - for example:

- View local log files in your dashboard
- Manage your player's balance remotely (I'm looking at you, Enchaned Banking ðŸ‘€)
- Manage your player's group tags remotely
- Manage (Admin) permissions remotely
- Or simply access file contents in your own application
