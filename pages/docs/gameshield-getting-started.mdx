# Getting Started

Let's get started by configuring **GameShield** to parse information from your free [CFTools]() webhook.

We do this by providing it with a Discord Webhook URL. 

<Steps>

### Go to your CFTools dashboard [#go-to-dashboard]

First, go to your [CFTools dashboard](https://app.cftools.cloud/dashboard) and select the server you want to `Manage`

### Go to server integrations [#go-to-integrations]

Click `Integrations` in the left-hand menu

![go-to-integrations](/images/guides/gameshield-getting-started/go-to-integrations.png)

### Create Discord webhook

Select your existing CFTools webhook, or alternatively - let's create your first Discord - CFTools webhook

`Right-click` (click and hold on mobile) the channel where you want your webhook to be active, and select `Edit Channel`

Navigate to `Integrations` in the left-hand menu, click `Webhooks`, and create your new webhook. Optionally provide it with a custom name and avatar/profile icon.

When that's done, click the `Copy Webhook URL` button, keep this value somewhere safe - don't share it with anyone

### Discord Permissions

**GameShield** requires the `View Channel` and `Read Message History` permissions in the channel where you created this webook.

Right-click (press and hold on mobile) the channel where your webhook is active, and click `Edit Channel`.

Navigate to `Permissions` in the right-hand menu, click `+ (Add new permission overwrites)`, and select **GameShield** from the list of members and roles.

<Callout>Don't forget to click the green checks for `View Channel` and `Read Message History` after selecting **GameShield**</Callout>

### Create CFTools Webhook

Back on the CFTools dahsboard, click `New Webhook` on the page where we left off. Provide the `Discord Webhook URL` from earlier, select `Discord Webhook` in the type dropdown, and hit `Deploy`

### Select the events [#select-events]

Select the events you plan on using - the following screenshot has every event that **GameShield** will eventually handle, this includes every event **except** `cloud.restricted` and `cloud.authentication_error`

![select-events](/images/guides/gameshield-getting-started/select-events.png)

This table represents the required `events` (CFTools webhook events) for our feeds. This list will be gradually updated over time to account for new feeds, like chat and player-join/leave feeds.

| feed-type   | required `events` |
| :----- | :----: |
| kill    |  `player.kill`   |
| damage | `player.damage`  |
| ban | `ban.add` |

<Callout>The `ban.add` event is not in your default CFTools webhook settings - this is included as a separate module under "Ban Manager", the setup is entirely the same and you can have overlapping webhook configurations</Callout>

### Registering your webhook

To register your newly created webhook, use the `/add-webhook-listener` command and give it a unique new that allows you to identify it. Common names are `<Server Name>`, and `<Server Name> - Bans` for the ban feed.

<Callout>**GameShield** requires the `Manage Webhooks` permission for this command. This is so we can resolve the `user-id` and `channel-id` for this webhook. **GameShield** will never send messages through this webhook - the `Manage Webhooks` permission can be safely removed after using this command</Callout>

The second option is the `webhook url`, this is the **Discord** webhook URL that we created earlier in [creating a Discord webhook](#create-discord-webhook)

![register-webhook](/images/guides/gameshield-getting-started/register-webhook.png)

<Callout type="info">That's all! GameShield is now listening for messages from the webhook that we just created, and will parse information to be used in our feeds - but you're not done yet. In it's current state, **GameShield** will not be active, you will instead see the default CFTools webhook message - continue by [updating your webhook templates](/docs/gameshield-updating-webhook-templates)</Callout>

</Steps>
