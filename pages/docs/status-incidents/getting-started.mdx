# Getting Started

Projects in Status Incidents are services or applications that are being monitored for incidents. This page provides an overview of how to manage Projects in Status Incidents.

A project can be monitored, and incidents can be created for it. Projects can also have multiple services, and each incident can have multiple affected services.

## Configuring the bot

We strongly recommend performing the following actions before creating a project:

- Use the `/admin-role` command to ensure that only users with a specific role can perform administrative actions.
- Use the `/admin-log-channel` to ensure that all actions are logged to a specific channel.

<Steps>

### Use the `/projects create` command

Use the **`/projects create`** command to create a Project in Status Incidents.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out the [Create Project Options](#create-project-options) section for a list of available options.
</Callout>

### Configure Services

Use the **`/services create`** command to create a Service (or services) for the Project. This step is optional, but it is recommended to configure services for the project when applicable.

These are recommended because they allow you to organize your incidents and provide more context to your users.

### Configure Statuses

Use the **`/statuses edit`** command to edit a Status (or statuses) for the Project. This step is optional, and allows you to use custom labels, emojis, colors and statuses altogether for your projects.

### Configure Embeds

Use the **`/embeds configure`** command to edit Incidents embeds for this Project. This step is optional, and allows you to customize the embeds for your incidents on a per-project basis.
