# Incidents

An incident is an event that causes an unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of a service. Incidents can be created for a project, and can have multiple affected services.

## Managing Incidents

We strongly recommend performing the following actions before managing incidents:

- Use the `/admin-role` command to ensure that only users with a specific role can perform administrative actions.
- Use the `/admin-log-channel` to ensure that all actions are logged to a specific channel.

<Steps>

### Use the `/incidents create` command

Use the **`/incidents create`** command to create a new incident for a project.

### Sending updates

Use the **`/incidents update`** command to send updates to an incident.

</Steps>

## Notes

- Incidents can be created for a project, and can have multiple affected services.
- Incidents can be updated with new information, and can be resolved when the issue is fixed.
- Incidents can be created, updated, and resolved by users with the `/admin-role` role.
- Status `Resolved` sets resolution, and you'll be unable to provide any non-resolved updates (like `Monitoring`) without using `/incidents remove-status`.
- Status `Post Mortem` can only be used **once** **__after__** the incident is resolved.
- You should explore all the other `/incidents` subcommands to learn what else you can do with incidents.
