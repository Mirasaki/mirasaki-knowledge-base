# Getting Started

## Adding the bot

To add the bot to your server, click [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1170346553777598515&permissions=0&scope=bot%20applications.commands) and select the server you want to add it to.

## Discord Webhook

This project sends notifications through Discord webhooks, so that your users only ever see your **custom branded** messages. To set up a webhook, follow the steps below:

<Steps>
  ### Channel Settings
  `Right-click` (click and hold on mobile) the channel where you want your webhook to be active, and select `Edit Channel`
  ### Integrations
  Navigate to `Integrations` in the left-hand menu, click `Webhooks`, and create your new webhook. Provide it with a custom name and avatar/profile icon, so that your branding is consistent.
  ### Copy URL
  When that's done, click the `Copy Webhook URL` button, keep this value somewhere safe - don't share it with anyone
</Steps>

## Creating a collection

You can get started by adding a collection, which is a group of mods that you want to receive notifications for. To do this, run the `/collection create` command in your server, and provide the command options.

### Options

- **Name** - The name of the collection, this is what you'll use to reference it in command options later (not shown in notifications)
- **Webhook URL** - The URL you copied earlier, this is where notifications will be sent
- **Message** - The message that will be sent when along with the notification, you can ping members and roles here
- **Display Images** - Whether or not to display images in the notification
- **Display Meta** - Whether or not to display meta in the notifications, this includes the mod's tags, subscriptions, and favorites

The following options have been added since the screenshot was taken:

- **Game** - The game that the collection is for, this is used to determine which workshop to check for updates
- **Steam Query Port** - The Steam query port your server uses
- **Origin** - The origin address of the server (game-server port), in the following format: `1.1.1.1:2302`

## Adding mods to a collection

Once you've created a collection, you can add mods to it. There's multiple ways to add mods:

### Syncing with server

You can sync collections with your live server, so that any mod that is on your server at the time, will be added the selected collection. To do this, run the `/sync-mods-with-server` command in your server.

You will need to provide your public ip address, and the game-port that your server is running on. Follow the `123.123.123.123:2302` format.

We have plans to release a module that will automatically sync your collections with your server, so that you don't have to run this command manually.

### Manually

You can manually add mod ids using the `/mods track` command in your server. **25** mods can be added at a time, and you can add as many as you want. Space or comma separated. You can obtain mod id's by copying them from the workshop URL, or right-clicking on a mod showcase image and selecting `Copy Link Address` to get a URL if you're on the dedicated client.

## Done

That's it! You're all set up, and you should start receiving notifications when mods are updated. If you have any questions or feature requests, feel free to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mirasaki)
