# Server Monitor

<Callout>
  This module requires [`origin`](/docs/workshop-monitor/getting-started#options) and [`steam-query-port`](/docs/workshop-monitor/getting-started#options) to be configured for your **Collection**.
</Callout>

This module can be set-up to send out custom-branded notifications whenever your server is offline for longer than the configurable threshold. No branding is included by default, and it uses the same webhook approach so all your users will ever get to see is your branded webhook.

- Server status is checked every 30 seconds
- Server Monitors are linked to collections. You should consider a collection to be your game-server instance.
- Can be paused and resumed anytime
- Lots of customization
- Sensible defaults, you only have to provide a webhook to get started
- Automatically paused if your server is offline for 48 hours

## Prerequisites

This module requires the following options to be configured for your **Collection**:

- [`origin`](/docs/workshop-monitor/getting-started#options)
- [`steam-query-port`](/docs/workshop-monitor/getting-started#options)

If you've been using the bot since before this module released, this is how you update so that all new features are available for your collection/server:

**`/collection edit collection:YOUR_COLLECTION steam-query-port:27016 game:dayz origin:1.1.1.1:2302`**

<Callout type="info">
  Replace the ip and ports with your actual values. If you don't know what a steam-query-port is you don't have to include it, the default port `27016` will be used
</Callout>

## Creating a server monitor

Add a server monitor using the **`/server-monitor add`** command, and enjoy being notified when your server is offline for longer than the configurable threshold.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out [the command table](/docs/workshop-monitor/commands) if you're looking for this information in a more condensed format.
